## Overview

Text often contains references to the locations of events where we want to extract the location of the event. For example, consider this example tweet that reports a road traffic crash in Nairobi, Kenya, where we are interested in determining the location of the crash:

> crash occurred near garden city on thika road on your way towards roysambu.

The tweet contains three location references: (1) garden city, (2) thika road and (3) roysambu, where 'garden city' is the name of multiple locations that are over 20 kilometers apart. Here, we are interested in extracting the location of the garden city location on thika road that represents the crash site.

The Unique Location Extractor (ULEx) geoparses text to extract the unique location of events. The algorithm takes advantage of contextual information contained within text (references to roads or administrate areas, such as neighborhoods) and determines which location references do not reference the event of interest and should be ignored.

This package was originally developed to extract locations of road traffic crashes from reports of crashes via Twitter, specifically in the context of Nairobi, Kenya using the Twitter feed [@Ma3Route](https://twitter.com/Ma3Route?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `ulex` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("worldbank/rsocialwatcher")
```

## Main functions

The package contains two main functions:

* __augment_gazetteer:__ The backbone of locating events is looking up location references in a gazetteer, or geographic dictionary. The `augment_gazetteer` facilitates cleaning a gazetteer that may have been constructed from sources such as [OpenStreetMaps](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osmdata/vignettes/osmdata.html), [Geonames](https://github.com/ropensci/geonames) or [Google Maps](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/googleway/versions/2.7.1/topics/google_places).

* __locate_event:__ Takes text as input and returns the location of the relevant event. Key inputs include the text to geoparse, a gazetteer of landmarks, spatial files of roads and areas (e.g., neighborhoods) and a list of event words.

### Create location datasets <a name="create-loc-data"></a>

#### Dataset of Wards <a name="create-areas"></a>

We create a dataset of Wards in Nairobi from [GADM](https://gadm.org/data.html).

```{r, message = F, warning=F}
ken_sf <- gadm(country = "KEN", level = 3, path = tempdir()) %>% st_as_sf()
nbo_sf <- ken_sf %>%
  filter(NAME_1 %in% "Nairobi") %>%
  rename(name = NAME_3) %>%
  dplyr::select(name)

head(nbo_sf)
```

#### Dataset of roads <a name="create-roads"></a>

We create a dataset of roads from [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

```{r, message = F, warning=F}
roads_sf <- opq(st_bbox(nbo_sf), timeout = 999) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "highway", value = c("motorway",
                                             "trunk",

#### Dataset of landmarks (landmark gazetteer) <a name="create-landmarks"></a>

We create a gazetteer of landmarks from [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). From OpenStreetMaps, we use all amenities and bus stops.

```{r, message = F, warning=F}

amenities_sf <- opq(st_bbox(nbo_sf), timeout = 999) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "amenity") %>%

# augment_gazetteer

The `augment_gazetteer` function adds additional landmarks to account for different ways of saying the same landmark name. For example, raw gazetteers may contain long, formal names, where shorter versions of the name are more often used. In addition, the function facilitates removing landmarks names that are spurious or may confuse the algorithm; these include landmark names that are common words that may be used in different contexts, or frequent and generic landmarks such as `hotel`. Key components of the function include:

1. Adding additional landmarks based off of n-grams and skip-grams of landmark names. For example, from the original landmark `garden city mall`, the following landmarks will be added: `garden city`, `city mall`, and  `garden mall`.
2. Adding landmarks according to a set of rules: for example, if a landmark starts or ends with a certain word, an alternative version of the landmark is added that removes that word. Here, words along categories of landmarks are removed, where a user may not reference the category; for example, a user will more likely say `McDonalds` than `McDonalds restaurant.`
3. Removes landmarks that refer to large geographic areas (e.g., roads). Roads and areas are dealt with separately; this function focuses on cleaning a gazetteer of specific points/landmarks.
4. Determines whether a landmark should be categorized as `specific` or `general`. Specific landmarks are those where the name uniquely identifies a location. General landmarks are those where the names do no uniquely identify a location; however, a general landmark with contextual information such as a road can uniquely determine a location. Note that when multiple landmarks have the same name, but >90% of the landmarks are very closely clustered together, the landmarks in the cluster are designated as `specific` while the other 10% are designated as `general`. The `locate_event` function only considers general landmarks when contextual information (roads or areas) are also referenced in the text.

# locate_event

The `locate_event` function extracts landmarks from text and determines the unique location of events from the text.

To extract location references from text, the function implements the following steps. Some parts of each step will extract the same landmark so to some extent are redundant; however, they all in some circumstances uniquely add landmarks.

1. Determines whether any text matches names in the gazetteer. Both exact and 'fuzzy' matches (allowing a certain levenstein distance) are used.
2. Relying on words after prepositions to find locations. The algorithm starts with a word after a preposition and extracts all landmarks that contain that word. Then, the algorithm takes the next word in the text and further subsets the landmarks. This process is repeated until adding a word removes all landmarks. If a road or area (eg, neighborhood) is found in the previous step, only landmarks near that road or neighborhood are considered. Landmarks with the shortest number of words are kept (i.e., if this process finds 5 landmarks with 2 words and 7 landmarks with 3 words, only the 5 landmarks with 2 words are kept).
3. If a road or area is mentioned and a landmark is not near that road or landmark, longer versions of the landmark that are near the road or area are searched for. For example, if a user says `crash near garden on thika road`, the algorithm may extract multiple landmarks with the name `garden`, none of which are near thika road. It will then search for all landmarks that contain `garden` in them (e.g., `garden city mall`) that are near thika road.
4. If two roads are mentioned, the algorithm extracts the intersection of the roads.

After extracting landmarks, the algorithm chooses the correct landmark using a series of steps. These steps consider a defined list of event words (eg, for road traffic crashes, these could include 'crash', 'accident', 'overturn', etc), whether the user mentions a junction word (e.g., 'junction' or 'intersection') and a list of prepositions. Certain prepositions are given precedent over others to distinguish between locations indicating the location of an event versus locations further away that provide additional context; for example, `at` takes higher precedence that `towards`. The following main series of steps are used in the following order

1. Locations that follow the pattern [even word] [preposition] [location] are extracted.
2. Locations that follow the pattern [preposition] [location] are extracted. If multiple occurrences, the location near the higher order preposition is used. If a tie, the location closest to the event word is used. TODO: parameterize which should be prioritized: (1) location to event word or (2) preposition priority. Which one should we default and which should be tie-breaker? Not obvious, for example: `accident towards thika mall at garden city`.
3. If a junction word is used, two roads are mentioned, and the two roads intersect once, the intersection point is used.
4. The location closest to the event word is used.
5. If the location name has multiple locations, we (1) restrict to locations near any mentioned road or area, (2) check for a dominant cluster of locations and (3) prioritize certain landmark types over others (e.g., a user is more likely to reference a large, well known location type like a stadium).
6. If a landmark is not found, but a road or area are found, the road or area are returned. If a road and area are mentioned, the intersection of the road and area is returned.
