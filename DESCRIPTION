Description: Extracts coordinates of an event location from text based on dictionaries of landmarks, roads, and areas. Only returns the location of an event of interest and ignores other location references; for example, if determining the location of a road traffic crash from the text "crash near [location 1] heading towards [location 2]", only the coordinates of "location 1" would be returned. Moreover, accounts for differences in spelling between how a user references a location and how a location is captured in location dictionaries. For more information on the algorithm, see Milusheva et al. (2021) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0244317>.
