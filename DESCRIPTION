Description: Extracts coordiantes of an event location from text (i.e., geoparses text) based on datasets of landmarks, roads, and areas. Only returns the location of an event of interest and ignores other location references; for example, if determining the location of a road traffic crash from the text "crash near [location 1] heading towards [location 2]", only the coordinates of "location 1" would be returned.
