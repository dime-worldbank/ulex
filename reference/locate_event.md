## Arguments

- text:

  Vector of texts to be geolocated.

- landmark_gazetteer:

  `sf` spatial data.frame representing landmarks.

- landmark_gazetteer.name_var:

  Name of variable indicating `name` of landmark.

- landmark_gazetteer.type_var:

  Name of variable indicating `type` of landmark.

- roads:

  `sf` spatial data.frame representing roads.

- roads.name_var:

  Name of variable indicating `name` of road.

- areas:

  `sf` spatial data.frame representing areas, such as administrative
  areas or neighborhoods.

- areas.name_var:

  Name of variable indicating `name` of area.

- event_words:

  Vector of event words, representing events to be geocoded.

- prepositions_list:

  List of vectors of prepositions. Order of list determines order of
  preposition precedence. (Default:
  `list(c("at", "next to","around", "just after", "opposite","opp", "apa", "hapa","happened at", "just before","at the","outside", "right before"), c("near", "after", "toward", "along", "towards", "approach"), c("past","from","on"))`).

- junction_words:

  Vector of junction words to check for when determining intersection of
  roads. (Default: `c("intersection", "junction")`).

- false_positive_phrases:

  Common words found in text that include spurious location references
  (eg, **githurai bus** is the name of a bus, but **githurai** is also a
  place). These may be common phrases that should be checked and ignored
  in the text. (Default: `""`).

- type_list:

  List of vectors of types. Order of list determines order or type
  precedence. (Default: `NULL`).

- clost_dist_thresh:

  Distance (meters) as to what is considered "close"; for example, when
  considering whether a landmark is close to a road. (Default: `500`).

- fuzzy_match:

  Whether to implement fuzzy matching of landmarks using levenstein
  distance. (Default: `TRUE`).

- fuzzy_match.min_word_length:

  Minimum word length to use for fuzzy matching; vector length must be
  the same as `fuzzy_match.dist`. (Default: `c(5,11)`).

- fuzzy_match.dist:

  Allowable levenstein distances for fuzzy matching; vector length must
  be same as `fuzzy_match.min_word_length`. (Default: `c(1,2)`).

- fuzzy_match.ngram_max:

  The number of n-grams that should be extracted from text to calculate
  a levensteing distance against landmarks. For example, if the text is
  composed of 5 words: w1 w2 w3 w4 and `fuzzy_match.ngram_max = 3`, the
  function extracts `w1 w2 w3` and compares the levenstein distance to
  all landmarks. Then in checks `w2 w3 w4`, etc. (Default: `3`).

- fuzzy_match.first_letters_same:

  When implementing a fuzzy match, should the first letter of the
  original and found word be the same? (Default: `TRUE`).

- fuzzy_match.last_letters_same:

  When implementing a fuzzy match, should the last letter of the
  original and found word be the same? (Default: `TRUE`).

- quiet:

  If `FALSE`, prints text that is being geocoded. (Default: `TRUE`).

- mc_cores:

  If \> 1, uses geolocates events in parallel across multiple cores
  relying on the `parallel` package. (Default: `1`).

## Value

`sf` spatial dataframe of geolocated events.
